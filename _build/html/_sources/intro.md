This set of notebooks is designed to showcase some useful tools for making production quality figures with matplotlib. More content will be added soon, so stay tuned.

To download and modify any of the notebooks, you can click on the GitHub icon at the top of the page to go to the source repository which contains all the jupyter notebooks (in the notebooks/ folder) as well as all the data that you will need to run them.
